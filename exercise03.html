<p>Hi! I am a fourth year graphic design major here are Dominican University. I have spent most of my life learning to 
    design and being a creative soul. I really take my design seriosuly, and it is something I am passionate about. 
    When I am not drawing or creating, I can be found curled up reading a good book, or even just hanging around with my friends!
